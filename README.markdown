###The different between log tagging and log levels
In traditional logging libraries like Ruby's [Logger](http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Logger.html) and Python's [Logging](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html), each log entry is assigned a `log level`, such as 'fatal', 'error', 'warn', 'info', or 'debug'.

###Why log tagging is better than log levels
Okay, I admit it: the heading for this section is unnecessarily divisive.  Log levels have their place

Log levels (either numerical or something like `debug`, `info`, `critical`)

etc etc

#### before tagalog

here i am editing `feature1.py`
    def factory(inputDictionary):
        # i wonder what's going on in the input dictionary
    

#### There are two ways to develop:
- with an IDE
- with **tagalog**

...we'll just focus on the latter :)

#### why use tagalog?
